## Introduction:
Music is a powerful art form that touches our hearts, stimulates our minds, and enriches our lives. Its ability to communicate emotions, unite people, and provide a means of self-expression makes it an essential part of human culture and a source of joy and inspiration for millions of people worldwide.

Music therapy, or MT, is using music to improve an individual's stress, mood, and overall mental health. MT is also recognized as an evidence-based practice, using music as a catalyst for "happy" hormones such as oxytocin.
